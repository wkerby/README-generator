# README Generator
## Description

As part of our ninth weekly challenge, we were tasks with using the inquirer package and the node.js runtime environment to create a program to take user input and create a professional README markdown file

As part of this assignment, I applied my newly-learned skills in the following:

- node.js
- npm (node package manager)
- JavaScript template literals
- inquirer package for node.js
- fs package for reading and writing files

## Usage

When the end-user executes the program, he/she answers a series of questions which the inquirer package stores in an answers object. The repsonses are then mapped to the README.md file to facilitate the README.md creation

- NOTE: an example of a README.md file generated from this program can be found in the README-generator/Develop directory with the name README.md
- See below for a link to the demonstration video in which the current README.md was generated:

## Credits

The portfolio website was completed in conjunction with the software development boot camp provided by the Georgia Tech professional development program.

Some useful pages I used to help me though the assignment include:

## Features

- Interactive and end-user input driven program that generates a README.md file
- Badge included with license selected by end-user
- Anchors in .md file that direct consumer to section of .md file to avoid unnecessary scrolling
